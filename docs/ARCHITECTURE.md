# Architecture Design

## Overview

This inference framework adopts a modular design with the following core components:

## Core Components

### 1. Tensor

Tensor is the fundamental data structure of the framework, used for storing and manipulating multi-dimensional arrays.

**Key Features:**
- Support for multiple data types (FLOAT32, FLOAT16, INT32, INT8, etc.)
- Dynamic shape management
- Automatic memory management
- Type-safe data access

**Key Methods:**
- `shape()` - Get tensor shape
- `numel()` - Get total number of elements
- `reshape()` - Reshape tensor
- `data_ptr<T>()` - Typed data access

### 2. Operator

Operators are the basic computation units, each implementing specific mathematical operations.

**Operator Base Class:**
```cpp
class Operator {
    virtual std::vector<Tensor> forward(const std::vector<Tensor>& inputs) = 0;
};
```

**Built-in Operators:**
- Conv2d - 2D convolution
- MaxPool2d - Max pooling
- Linear - Fully connected layer
- ReLU - Activation function
- Softmax - Normalization
- MatMul - Matrix multiplication
- Add - Element-wise addition

**Extension Mechanism:**
Users can inherit from the `Operator` base class to implement custom operators.

### 3. Model

Model manages the computation graph and inference workflow.

**Computation Graph:**
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) composed of multiple operator nodes
- Nodes connected through tensor indices
- Support for multiple inputs and outputs

**Main Functions:**
- Add operators to computation graph
- Model serialization and deserialization
- Forward inference execution

### 4. InferenceEngine

The inference engine provides a high-level interface with complete inference functionality.

**Configuration Options:**
- Number of threads
- FP16 support
- Profiling
- Workspace size

**Features:**
- Model loading and optimization
- Synchronous/asynchronous inference
- Performance profiling and statistics
- Warmup mechanism

## Data Flow

```
Input Data -> Tensor
    |
    v
Model.forward()
    |
    v
Execute Computation Graph
    |
    +-> Operator1.forward()
    |       |
    |       v
    |   Intermediate Tensor
    |       |
    +-> Operator2.forward()
    |       |
    ...
    |
    v
Output Tensor
```

## Memory Management

### Tensor Memory
- Use RAII to manage memory lifecycle
- Support move semantics to reduce copying
- Lazy allocation strategy

### Workspace
- Engine maintains unified workspace
- Operators can request temporary memory
- Automatic release after inference

## Threading Model

### Operator-level Parallelism
- Single operator can execute with multiple threads
- Thread pool manages worker threads
- Load balancing

### Batch Parallelism
- Support parallel processing of batched inputs
- Data parallelism strategy

## Optimization Strategies

### Compile-time Optimization
1. **Operator Fusion**
   - Conv + ReLU -> ConvReLU
   - BatchNorm + Scale -> BNScale

2. **Constant Folding**
   - Pre-compute constant expressions
   - Reduce runtime computation

### Runtime Optimization
1. **Memory Reuse**
   - Intermediate tensor memory pool
   - Reduce allocation/deallocation overhead

2. **Instruction Optimization**
   - SIMD vectorization
   - CPU affinity settings

## Extensibility

### Adding New Operators
1. Inherit from `Operator` base class
2. Implement `forward()` method
3. Register with operator factory

### Supporting New Hardware
1. Implement hardware abstraction layer
2. Provide device-specific operator implementations
3. Register device backend

## Future Plans

- GPU support (CUDA/OpenCL)
- Model quantization (INT8/INT4)
- Dynamic shape support
- Subgraph partitioning and heterogeneous execution
- More operator implementations
- ONNX format support
